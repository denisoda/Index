            <section>
                I'm a person who really loves what he does! My passion is technologies and everything that relatives with it! For my young age, I already have a lot of experience and a bunch of finished
                projects! Although I'm still studying at University I started my trip to the amazing word of
                technologies from my early childhood! I'm familiar with wide range of technologies started from the
                bottom as the assembly for the x86 architecture ends with high-level programming languages as
                Python. So, I'm familiar, with this set of interpreted languages such as Python, JavaScript,
                TypeScript, and my favorite one is BashScript for Unix system. "Familiar" means that I had
                experience with it and have already finished projects on it. And my set of compiling languages are
                C#, C++, C. I had experience in web development as well, my tool is Angular4 for front-end
                development.Also, I deeply understand object orientated programming (OOP) as working servers, and how they communicate with each
                other and with a client I'm speaking about HTTP protocol and the REST API. Also, I'm
                familiar with databases, what would be doing without them :) About my team collaboration, I'm able
                to use CVS such as GIT, and I have good communication skills for managing and motivation team,
                but I do feel myself not bad as manageable member, but I can't hide the passion of improvement
                of everything.About my dream job, it has to be place with peoples who as me love their job. And as
                I mentioned before I have nice communication skills and good English, so
                I can maintain a fluent conversation with costumes and my future team. If you're already on this
                point, I do appreciate your interest for my person :)
